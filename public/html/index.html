          <h4>Why You Should Workout</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
              Experts recommend that teens get 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. Here are some of the reasons:<br>
              Exercise benefits every part of the body, including the mind.<br> Exercising causes the body to make chemicals that can help a person to feel good.<br> Exercise can help people sleep better.
              Exercise can help you look better.<br> People who exercise burn more calories and look more toned than those who don't. In fact, exercise can help keep your body at a healthy weight.<br>
              Exercise helps people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases.<br> Exercising regularly decreases a person's risk of developing certain diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. <br>
              Exercise can help a person age well. This may not seem important now, but your body will thank you later. For example, osteoporosis (a weakening of the bones) can be a problem as people get older. Weight-bearing exercise — like jumping, running, or brisk walking — can help keep bones strong.
              The three parts of a balanced exercise routine are: aerobic exercise, strength training, and flexibility training.<br>

            <h4>Why You Need To Eat Healthy</h4>
            <p class="left-align light">
              Unhealthy eating habits have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States: about one-third of
              U.S. adults (33.8%) are obese and approximately 17% (or 12.5 million) of children and adolescents aged
              2—19 years are obese.1 Even for people at a healthy weight, a poor diet is associated with major health
              risks that can cause illness and even death. These include heart disease, hypertension (high blood
              pressure), type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. By making smart food choices, you
              can help protect yourself from these health problems.

              The risk factors for adult chronic diseases, like hypertension and type 2 diabetes, are increasingly seen
              in younger ages, often a result of unhealthy eating habits and increased weight gain. Dietary habits
              established in childhood often carry into adulthood, so teaching children how to eat healthy at a young
              age will help them stay healthy throughout their life.

              The link between good nutrition and healthy weight, reduced chronic disease risk, and overall health is
              too important to ignore. By taking steps to eat healthy, you'll be on your way to getting the nutrients
              your body needs to stay healthy, active, and strong. As with physical activity, making small changes in
              your diet can go a long way, and it's easier than you think!<br>
